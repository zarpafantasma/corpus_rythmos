Figure 1: RTM-Cosmology: The Acceleration of Early StructureFigure 1: The Acceleration of Early Structure.Log-log plot of the apparent mass growth rate ($M_\star / t_{age}$) versus redshift factor $(1+z)$ for the high-redshift galaxy sample.The positive slope indicates that as we look further back in time (higher $z$), the apparent efficiency of mass assembly increases. In a standard linear-time universe ($\alpha=0$), this rate should be constant or decreasing. The observed increase implies that the "clocks" governing structure formation were running faster in the early universe, consistent with an RTM scaling law where $\tau \propto L^\alpha$.

Figure 2: RTM-Cosmology: The "Alpha" of Early GalaxiesFigure 2: The "Alpha" of Early Galaxies.Scatter plot showing the required Coherence Exponent ($\alpha$) for each "impossible" galaxy to be reconcilable with standard Eddington-limited growth.We invert the RTM equation $A = (1+z)^{1.5\alpha}$ to find the $\alpha$ that reduces the Acceleration Factor to unity ($A=1$). The data clusters tightly around a mean value of $\alpha \approx 1.24$ (Black Dashed Line), with a theoretical range between $1.0$ (Linear Gravity) and $1.5$ (Causal Horizon Limit). This confirms that a moderate time-rescaling is sufficient to explain the JWST anomalies without exotic physics.Figure 3: RTM-Cosmology: Acceleration of the "Impossible" Galaxies

Figure 3: Acceleration of the "Impossible" Galaxies.Focused analysis of the hyper-massive population ($M_\star > 10^{9.5} M_\odot$), including Labbé et al. candidates and UHZ1.The red regression line fits the apparent growth rate of these extreme outliers. The derived scaling confirms that the "impossibility" (or the magnitude of the mass excess) scales predictably with redshift. This suggests that the anomaly is not due to random measurement errors or isolated "monsters," but is a systematic feature of the early universe's thermodynamic metric.
