S3: Substrate Selectivity Prediction by α
==========================================
Date: 2026-02-14 14:02:20

RTM SELECTIVITY PREDICTION
--------------------------
If substrates A and B have different α values:

k_A(L) = k_A,0 × (L/L_ref)^(-α_A)
k_B(L) = k_B,0 × (L/L_ref)^(-α_B)

Selectivity: S = k_A/k_B ∝ L^(α_B - α_A)

KEY INSIGHT:
If Δα = α_A - α_B > 0:
  - Substrate A benefits MORE from confinement
  - Small L enhances selectivity for A
  - Crossover possible if k_B_0 > k_A_0 in bulk

SCENARIO RESULTS
----------------

CYP450 Drug Metabolism
  α_A = 2.4, α_B = 1.9
  Δα = 0.50
  S_bulk = 0.67
  S(20nm) = 1.49
  Crossover L = 44 nm

Lipase Enantioselectivity
  α_A = 2.3, α_B = 2.1
  Δα = 0.20
  S_bulk = 1.11
  S(20nm) = 1.53
  Crossover L = 169 nm

Allosteric Regulation
  α_A = 2.2, α_B = 2.5
  Δα = -0.30
  S_bulk = 1.67
  S(20nm) = 1.03
  Crossover L = 18 nm

APPLICATIONS
------------
1. DRUG METABOLISM
   - P450 isoforms show differential confinement effects
   - Membrane environment affects selectivity
   - Tunable by lipid composition (effective L)

2. INDUSTRIAL BIOCATALYSIS
   - Immobilization pore size affects enantioselectivity
   - Design support matrix for optimal E-ratio
   - Predict optimal confinement from α measurements

3. METABOLIC REGULATION
   - Crowded cytoplasm (L_eff ~10-30nm)
   - Allosteric regulation couples to α changes
   - Compartmentalization as selectivity tool

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
-----------------------
1. Measure k_cat for A and B at multiple L values
2. Fit α_A and α_B independently
3. Predict crossover from fitted parameters
4. Test prediction at L_crossover

RBCI AS QUALITY INDEX
---------------------
RBCI aggregates:
- α normalization (30%)
- CISS spin signature (25%)
- Vibrational coherence (25%)
- Variance reduction under driving (20%)

High RBCI (>0.6): robust RTM scaling expected
Low RBCI (<0.3): deviations from RTM likely
