S1: Synthetic Rotation Curves with RTM
======================================

Date: 2026-02-13 21:12:18

IMPORTANT: This is a MODEL ILLUSTRATION, not empirical validation.

RTM MODEL
---------
v ∝ r^(1 - α/2)

Slope = 1 - α/2:
  α = 2.0 → slope = 0 (flat)
  α < 2.0 → slope > 0 (rising)
  α > 2.0 → slope < 0 (declining)

SCENARIOS TESTED
----------------
  α=2 everywhere: α=2.00, slope=0.000
  α=1.8 everywhere: α=1.80, slope=0.100
  α: 2.4→2.0: α=2.09, slope=-0.067
  Bar (α=2.6) + Disk (α=2.0): α=2.07, slope=-0.096

WHAT THIS SHOWS
---------------
✓ RTM velocity law produces expected curve shapes
✓ Varying α(r) creates realistic-looking rotation curves
✓ Flat outer curves require α ≈ 2

WHAT THIS DOES NOT SHOW
-----------------------
✗ That RTM is physically correct
✗ That α can be measured from structure
✗ That dark matter is unnecessary
✗ Comparison with real galaxy data

NEXT STEPS FOR VALIDATION
-------------------------
1. Measure α independently from baryonic structure proxies
2. Compare predicted slopes with observed rotation curves
3. Test collapse condition (residuals flat vs r)
4. Check bTFR residuals correlate with α-proxies
