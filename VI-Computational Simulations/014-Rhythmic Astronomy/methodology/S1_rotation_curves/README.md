# S1: Synthetic Rotation Curves with RTM

## Purpose
Illustrates what RTM predicts for rotation curves given different α(r) profiles.

## Key Result
v ∝ r^(1-α/2):
- α = 2 → flat curve
- α < 2 → rising curve
- α > 2 → declining curve

## Disclaimer
This illustrates MODEL PREDICTIONS, not empirical validation.
Real testing requires observed rotation curves.
