# S3: bTFR Residuals and α-Correlation

## Purpose
Demonstrates RTM PREDICTION that bTFR residuals correlate with structural coherence.

## Key Result
In synthetic data designed to follow RTM:
- Residuals correlate with α (r ≈ 0.22)
- Residuals do NOT correlate with mass

## Discriminant
- DM: residuals → halo parameters
- MOND: residuals → acceleration scale  
- RTM: residuals → structural coherence

## Disclaimer
Synthetic data showing expected signal. Real validation requires observed galaxies.
