S3: bTFR Residuals and α-Correlation
=====================================

Date: 2026-02-13 21:13:11

IMPORTANT: This is a MODEL PREDICTION test, not empirical validation.

RTM PREDICTION
--------------
bTFR residuals should correlate with structural coherence (α)
because v(r) ∝ r^(1-α/2), so sampling at different α gives offsets.

SYNTHETIC RESULTS
-----------------
Sample size: 200 galaxies

Correlations with bTFR residuals:
  Mass:      r = -0.1075 (weak, as expected)
  Structure: r = 0.2179 (RTM predicts: significant)
  α:         r = 0.2179 (RTM predicts: significant)

Model comparison:
  RTM R² = 0.0475
  F-stat = 9.9, p = 1.94e-03

DISCRIMINANT
------------
DM prediction: residuals → halo parameters
MOND prediction: residuals → acceleration scale
RTM prediction: residuals → structural coherence

WHAT THIS SHOWS
---------------
✓ RTM makes a distinct, testable prediction
✓ The predicted correlation has a clear signature
✓ This could discriminate RTM from alternatives

WHAT THIS DOES NOT SHOW
-----------------------
✗ That real galaxy data shows this correlation
✗ That RTM is correct
✗ That DM/MOND predictions fail

REQUIRED FOR VALIDATION
-----------------------
1. Real bTFR data (SPARC, THINGS, LITTLE THINGS)
2. Independent α estimation from structure
3. Compare correlation strengths across models
