S2: Slope Fitting and Collapse Test
====================================

Date: 2026-02-13 21:12:27

METHODOLOGY VALIDATION
----------------------
This validates the RTM analysis pipeline on SYNTHETIC data
where the true α is known.

TEST CASE 1: Constant α = 2.0
  Mean α error: +0.0244
  Collapse pass rate: 100%
  Result: METHODOLOGY WORKS

TEST CASE 2: Varying α(r)
  Mean α error: -0.1039
  Collapse pass rate: 100%
  Result: METHODOLOGY WORKS

WHAT THIS VALIDATES
-------------------
✓ Slope fitting correctly recovers α from synthetic data
✓ Collapse test identifies valid RTM bins
✓ Error propagation is reasonable

WHAT THIS DOES NOT VALIDATE
---------------------------
✗ That real galaxy data follows RTM
✗ That α can be estimated from structural proxies
✗ That dark matter is unnecessary

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Apply pipeline to real rotation curve data
2. Derive α independently from structure (entropy, Fourier modes)
3. Test if kinematic α matches structural α
