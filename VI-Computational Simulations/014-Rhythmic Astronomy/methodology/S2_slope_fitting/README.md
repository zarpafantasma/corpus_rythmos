# S2: Slope Fitting and Collapse Test

## Purpose
Validates the RTM analysis METHODOLOGY on synthetic data where α is known.

## Key Result
- Slope fitting recovers α correctly
- Collapse test identifies valid RTM bins
- Method works on synthetic data

## Disclaimer
Validates the METHOD, not the physical hypothesis.
Real testing requires observed galaxy data.
