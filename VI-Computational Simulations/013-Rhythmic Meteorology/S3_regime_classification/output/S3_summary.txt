S3: Atmospheric Regime Classification by α
===========================================
Date: 2026-02-14 18:15:45

RTM-ATMO CLASSIFICATION SCHEME
------------------------------
α serves as a transport class indicator:

Advective (α = 0.8-1.5):
  - Fast decorrelation, fragmented
  - Examples: Easterly waves, trade cumulus, disturbances

Hierarchical (α = 1.5-2.0):
  - Moderate organization, multi-scale
  - Examples: Fronts, baroclinic waves, MCS

Coherent (α = 2.0-2.5):
  - Organized, persistent features
  - Examples: Mature cyclones, jets

Strongly Coherent (α = 2.5-3.5):
  - Quasi-stationary, long-lived
  - Examples: Blocking, major hurricanes

WEATHER PATTERN α VALUES
------------------------
Trade Cumulus: α = 1.1 (Advective)
Easterly Wave: α = 1.2 (Advective)
Sea Breeze: α = 1.3 (Advective)
Afternoon Thunderstorms: α = 1.4 (Advective)
Warm Front: α = 1.6 (Hierarchical)
Cold Front: α = 1.7 (Hierarchical)
MCS: α = 1.7 (Hierarchical)
Squall Line: α = 1.8 (Hierarchical)
Developing Low: α = 1.9 (Hierarchical)
Category 1 Hurricane: α = 2.1 (Coherent)
Mature Extratropical: α = 2.2 (Coherent)
Subtropical High: α = 2.2 (Coherent)
Jet Streak: α = 2.3 (Coherent)
Major Hurricane: α = 2.6 (Strongly Coherent)
Blocking High: α = 2.8 (Strongly Coherent)
Polar Vortex: α = 2.9 (Strongly Coherent)
Rex Block: α = 3.0 (Strongly Coherent)

CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE
--------------------------
Overall Accuracy: 87.0%

Per-Class Metrics:
  Advective: P=0.87, R=0.92, F1=0.89
  Hierarchical: P=0.85, R=0.80, F1=0.83
  Coherent: P=0.82, R=0.85, F1=0.83
  Strongly Coherent: P=0.94, R=0.92, F1=0.93

OPERATIONAL USE
---------------
1. Compute rolling α from reanalysis/satellite data
2. Classify regime automatically
3. Use regime for:
   - Forecast guidance (persistence vs. change)
   - Warning thresholds (regime-dependent)
   - Verification stratification

TRANSITION DETECTION
--------------------
Class changes (e.g., Advective → Hierarchical) indicate:
- Development (increasing α)
- Decay (decreasing α)
- Reorganization (non-monotonic α)

These transitions are key forecasting targets.
