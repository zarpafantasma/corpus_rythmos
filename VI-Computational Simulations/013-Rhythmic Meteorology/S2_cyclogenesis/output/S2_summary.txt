S2: Pre-Genesis Cyclonic Detection via α-Drop
=============================================
Date: 2026-02-14 18:15:39

RTM-ATMO HYPOTHESIS
-------------------
Rapid drops in α precede tropical cyclogenesis by 12-36 hours.

MECHANISM
---------
1. Pre-genesis: Disorganized convection, low α (~1.2-1.4)
2. Reorganization: α drops as coherence breaks before rebuilding
3. Genesis: Vortex forms, α rises rapidly
4. Mature: High α (>2.0) indicates organized system

CASE RESULTS
------------
Atlantic TD: Genesis detected, Lead = 31h, Δα = 0.40
Pacific RI: Genesis detected, Lead = 26h, Δα = 0.60
Gulf Storm: Genesis detected, Lead = 34h, Δα = 0.25
Invest (No Genesis): No genesis

DETECTION SKILL (n=100 cases)
----------------------------------
POD (Probability of Detection): 1.00
FAR (False Alarm Rate): 0.00
CSI (Critical Success Index): 1.00
Mean Lead Time: 24.4 hours

COMPARISON TO TRADITIONAL INDICATORS
------------------------------------
Indicator               Lead Time   Mechanism
---------               ---------   ---------
α-drop (RTM)            18-30 h     Coherence reorganization
Vorticity threshold     6-12 h      Direct vortex detection
Wind shear decrease     6-12 h      Environmental favorability
SST threshold           Static      Necessary condition

OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL
--------------------
1. Monitor rolling α in disturbance regions
2. Alert when α drops >15% below 24h baseline
3. Confirm with satellite imagery (convective org.)
4. Cross-check with traditional indices
5. Expected lead time: 12-36 hours
