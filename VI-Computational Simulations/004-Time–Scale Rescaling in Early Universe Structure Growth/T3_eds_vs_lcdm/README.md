# T3: Einstein-de Sitter vs ΛCDM Comparison

From "Time–Scale Rescaling in Early Universe Structure Growth"

## Overview
Detailed comparison of EdS and ΛCDM cosmological backgrounds for the RTM acceleration factor.

## Key Finding
EdS overestimates A at high z. ΛCDM gives more realistic values:
- z=10: A_EdS ≈ 36, A_ΛCDM ≈ 20
- Both still sufficient for the RTM mechanism

## Usage
```bash
python T3_eds_vs_lcdm.py
```
