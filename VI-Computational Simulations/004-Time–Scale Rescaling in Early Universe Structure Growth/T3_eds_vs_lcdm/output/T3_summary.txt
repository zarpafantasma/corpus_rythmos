T3: EdS vs ΛCDM Comparison
==========================

Date: 2026-02-08 23:45:24

COSMOLOGICAL MODELS
-------------------
Einstein-de Sitter (EdS):
  - Matter-only universe (Ω_m = 1, Ω_Λ = 0)
  - H(z)/H_0 = (1+z)^(3/2)
  - A = (1+z)^(3α/2)
  - Age: t = (2/3H_0)(1+z)^(-3/2)

ΛCDM (Planck 2018):
  - Ω_m = 0.315, Ω_Λ = 0.685
  - H(z)/H_0 = √[Ω_m(1+z)³ + Ω_Λ]
  - A = [Ω_m(1+z)³ + Ω_Λ]^(α/2)

KEY RESULTS (α = 1)
-------------------
         |    EdS    |   ΛCDM   
z = 5    |  A = 14.7  |  A = 8.3
z = 10   |  A = 36.5  |  A = 20.5
z = 15   |  A = 64.0 |  A = 35.9
z = 20   |  A = 96.2 |  A = 54.0

COSMIC AGES
-----------
z = 10:  EdS = 0.265 Gyr,  ΛCDM = 0.472 Gyr
z = 15:  EdS = 0.151 Gyr,  ΛCDM = 0.269 Gyr

WHY THE DIFFERENCE?
-------------------
EdS overestimates A at high z because it assumes Ω_m = 1.
ΛCDM accounts for dark energy, giving more realistic (lower) A values.

The paper uses EdS for pedagogical clarity ("58×") but notes
that ΛCDM gives A ~ 30-40, still sufficient for the mechanism.
