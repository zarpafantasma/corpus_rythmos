# T4: Parameter Space Explorer

From "Time–Scale Rescaling in Early Universe Structure Growth"

## Overview
Explores the full parameter space (α, ε, z, N_dyn) to identify which combinations can explain observed high-z galaxy masses.

## Usage
```bash
python T4_parameter_space.py
```

## Key Finding
With α ~ 1 and ε ~ 2-5%, RTM can explain JWST observations without exotic physics.
