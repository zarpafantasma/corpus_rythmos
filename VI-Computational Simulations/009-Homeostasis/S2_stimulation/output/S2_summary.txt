====================================================
Date: 2026-02-14 18:29:00

STIMULATION PROTOCOL
--------------------
Modalities:
1. Acoustic: 174-432 Hz coherent tones
2. PEMF: 7.83 Hz (Schumann), 10 µT
3. Light: 635 nm red, 50 mW/cm²
4. Biofeedback: Real-time HRV coherence

Duration: 60 minutes

RESPONSE MODEL
--------------
C_bio(t) = Baseline + Δ_max × (1 - exp(-t/τ_rise)) [during stim]
C_bio(t) = Baseline + Peak × exp(-t/τ_decay) [after stim]

τ_rise = 10 min
τ_decay = 30 min
Max effect: +0.08 (full protocol, 100% intensity)

PROTOCOL COMPARISON
-------------------
Full Protocol: ΔC_bio = +0.084 (46.9%)
Acoustic + Biofeedback: ΔC_bio = +0.044 (24.2%)
Light Only (High): ΔC_bio = +0.020 (11.1%)
Low Intensity Full: ΔC_bio = +0.042 (23.5%)

INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY
----------------------
Mean ΔC_bio: 0.134
Mean % change: 81.2%
Individual sensitivity range: 0.5x to 1.5x

BASELINE EFFECTS
----------------
Lower baseline → larger absolute response
Higher baseline → smaller marginal gain

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. Multimodal > sum of single modalities (synergy)
2. 15-20% increase in C_bio achievable acutely
3. Effect peaks at ~60 min, decays over ~30 min
4. Individual variation ~30% around mean response

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
---------------------
1. Full multimodal protocol recommended
2. Single modalities less effective
3. Consider baseline when setting expectations
4. Repeated sessions may have cumulative effects
