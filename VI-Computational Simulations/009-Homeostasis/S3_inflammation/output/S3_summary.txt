S3: Prediction of Inflammatory Markers from C_bio
=================================================
Date: 2026-02-14 18:29:05

MODEL
-----
Inflammatory markers scale inversely with C_bio:
Marker = Baseline × Age_factor × exp(-k × (C_bio - threshold))

MARKER PARAMETERS
-----------------
CRP:    k = 8,  threshold = 0.15, normal < 3 mg/L
IL-6:   k = 10, threshold = 0.12, normal < 7 pg/mL
TNF-α:  k = 6,  threshold = 0.10, normal < 8 pg/mL

ACUTE STIMULATION EFFECTS
-------------------------
Scenario: C_bio^log 0.15 → 0.22 (typical stimulation response)

CRP reduction: 42.8%
IL-6 reduction: 50.3%

Response time constants:
  CRP: ~4 hours to new equilibrium
  IL-6: ~2 hours
  TNF-α: ~3 hours

POPULATION CORRELATIONS (n=150)
----------------------------------------
C_bio vs CRP: r = -0.850 (p < 0.001)
C_bio vs IL-6: r = -0.743 (p < 0.001)

AGE EFFECTS
-----------
At same C_bio, older individuals have:
  CRP: +1% per year above age 40
  IL-6: +1.5% per year above age 40

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
---------------------
1. Low C_bio (<0.12) associated with elevated CRP/IL-6
2. Increasing C_bio via stimulation → inflammatory reduction
3. Effect size: ~20-40% reduction in markers achievable
4. Monitoring C_bio may predict inflammatory trajectory

CAUTIONS
--------
- Acute changes shown; chronic effects may differ
- Individual variation substantial (~20-25% CV)
- Model requires validation with clinical data
