# T3: GR vs RTM Decomposition

From "Black Holes in the RTM Framework"

## Overview
Demonstrates the key decomposition:
- RTM affects SLOPES (α changes with r)
- GR affects INTERCEPTS (Z changes with r)

## Test Logic
- Slopes vary with radius → RTM is active
- Only intercepts vary → Pure GR (no RTM)
