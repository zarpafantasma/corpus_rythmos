# T1: RTM α(r) Profile Calculator

From "Black Holes in the RTM Framework"

## Overview
Calculates the environmental coherence exponent α as a function of radius r.

## Key Equations
- Logistic: α(r) = α_∞ + (α₀ - α_∞) / [1 + exp(-(r - r_t)/w)]
- GR redshift: Z(r) = 1 / √(1 - r_s/r)

## Usage
```bash
python T1_alpha_profile.py
```

## Key Insight
α increases inward as confinement/organization grows.
This is the RTM prediction for black hole environments.
