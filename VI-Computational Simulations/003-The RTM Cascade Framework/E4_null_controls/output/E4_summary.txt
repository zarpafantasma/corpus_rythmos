E4: Null Controls (Flat Slopes and Symmetric Causality)
=====================================================

Date: 2026-02-08 23:18:29

PURPOSE
-------
Verify that S1 and S2 tests correctly return NULL when there is no cascade.
This protects against false positives.

S1 NULL TEST: FLAT SLOPES
-------------------------
Model: T_n(L) = c_n * L^α * ε with CONSTANT α = 2.3 for all layers.
       Intercepts c_n vary but slopes are identical.

Expected: Δα CIs should include 0 (no monotone trend)
Result: NULL CONFIRMED ✓

Layer α estimates:
  Layer 0: α = 2.3026 [2.2902, 2.3154]
  Layer 1: α = 2.3071 [2.2930, 2.3206]
  Layer 2: α = 2.3004 [2.2874, 2.3136]
  Layer 3: α = 2.2989 [2.2853, 2.3128]

Differences:
  Δα(0→1) = 0.0045 [-0.0321, 0.0411] ✓ includes 0
  Δα(1→2) = -0.0067 [-0.0440, 0.0306] ✓ includes 0
  Δα(2→3) = -0.0015 [-0.0387, 0.0357] ✓ includes 0

S2 NULL TEST: SYMMETRIC CAUSALITY
---------------------------------
Model: Y_n(t) = ε_n(t) (independent noise, no coupling)

Expected: Granger F-stats similar in both directions, neither significant
Result: NULL CONFIRMED ✓

Causality tests:
  0↔1: GC_fwd F=1.08 (p=0.3713) GC_rev F=1.06 (p=0.3782) ✓ symmetric
  1↔2: GC_fwd F=0.59 (p=0.7095) GC_rev F=1.99 (p=0.0766) ✓ symmetric
  2↔3: GC_fwd F=0.42 (p=0.8357) GC_rev F=0.83 (p=0.5291) ✓ symmetric

OVERALL NULL CONTROL STATUS
---------------------------
S1 Null: CONFIRMED
S2 Null: CONFIRMED

INTERPRETATION
--------------
Both null controls should be CONFIRMED to validate that the S1/S2 tests
do not produce false positives. If they fail, the methodology may be
detecting spurious patterns.
