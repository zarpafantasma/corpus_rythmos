S3: Conscious Access Threshold Model
=====================================
Date: 2026-02-14 03:10:55

RTM-NEURO HYPOTHESIS
--------------------
Conscious access requires α ≥ 2.0 (threshold)
Higher α = more integrated multiscale dynamics
Below threshold = fragmented processing, no global access

STATE-SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS
--------------------------
State               Mean α   Time Above Threshold
-------------------------------------------------------
awake               2.19     94.1%
light_sedation      1.91     26.7%
deep_anesthesia     1.48     0.0%
rem_sleep           1.96     46.3%
nrem_n2             1.61     0.0%
nrem_n3             1.42     0.0%

KEY PREDICTIONS
---------------
1. ANESTHESIA INDUCTION
   - α drops below threshold → Loss of Consciousness (LOC)
   - Crossing time predicts behavioral LOC

2. EMERGENCE
   - α rises above threshold → Return of Consciousness (ROC)
   - Individual variability in crossing dynamics

3. BINDING EPISODES
   - Transient α peaks during working memory maintenance
   - Integration requires temporary elevation above baseline

4. PATHOLOGICAL PATTERNS
   Fragmented (DoC): Low mean α, rarely crosses threshold
   Rigid: Normal mean but pathologically low variance
   Unstable: Oscillations around threshold, intermittent access

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
---------------------
- α monitoring could predict LOC/ROC in anesthesia
- α variance may distinguish vegetative vs minimally conscious
- Real-time α tracking for closed-loop depth-of-anesthesia

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
1. EEG/MEG recordings during anesthesia induction/emergence
2. Behavioral markers of LOC/ROC timing
3. Correlation between α-threshold crossing and behavioral transition
4. Comparison with BIS, PCI, spectral entropy

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
--------------------
This is a THEORETICAL MODEL demonstrating how α-threshold
mechanics could explain consciousness phenomenology.

Empirical validation requires:
- Human subject recordings across states
- Ground-truth consciousness markers
- Prospective prediction testing
