# S3: Conscious Access Threshold Model

Models α dynamics and threshold crossing for consciousness.

## Simulations
1. State-specific α patterns
2. Anesthesia induction/emergence
3. Working memory binding episodes
4. Pathological patterns

## Key Result
α > 2.0 correlates with conscious states

## Run
```bash
python S3_conscious_threshold.py
```
