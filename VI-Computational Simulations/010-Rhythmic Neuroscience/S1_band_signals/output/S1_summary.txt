S1: Neural Signal Generation with Band-Specific α
================================================
Date: 2026-02-14 02:38:27

PARAMETERS
----------
Sampling rate: 1000 Hz
Duration: 60 s
Channels: 8 (multi-channel demo)

RTM α BY BAND
-------------
Delta (0.5-4 Hz):   α = 2.8
Theta (4-8 Hz):     α = 2.3
Alpha (8-13 Hz):    α = 2.0
Beta (13-30 Hz):    α = 1.7
Gamma (30-100 Hz):  α = 1.4

KEY FINDING
-----------
α decreases with increasing frequency, consistent with RTM prediction
that slower rhythms require higher coherence exponents for long-range
integration across cortical scales.

Fit: α ∝ f^-0.194 (R² = 0.988)

This relationship emerges from the constraint that slower oscillations
must maintain coherence over larger spatial extents (T ∝ L^α), requiring
steeper scaling of characteristic times with scale.
