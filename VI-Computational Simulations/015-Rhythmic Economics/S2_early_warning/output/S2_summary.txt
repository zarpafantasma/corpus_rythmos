S2: Backtesting α as Early Warning
====================================
Date: 2026-02-14 18:06:53

RTM-ECON HYPOTHESIS H2
----------------------
Sharp drops in α precede recessions by 6-18 months.

MECHANISM
---------
1. α captures cross-scale coherence (how timing varies with size)
2. Before recession: coherence degrades (α falls)
3. Timing across scales becomes more uniform
4. This enables rapid shock propagation (cascade risk)
5. Eventually, a shock triggers the recession

RECESSION ANALYSIS
------------------

2001 Dot-Com:
  α: 0.42 → 0.28 (Δα = 0.14)
  Lead time: 9 months
  Severity: moderate

2008 GFC:
  α: 0.45 → 0.18 (Δα = 0.27)
  Lead time: 15 months
  Severity: severe

2020 COVID:
  α: 0.40 → 0.22 (Δα = 0.18)
  Lead time: 3 months
  Severity: sharp

SUMMARY STATISTICS
------------------
Mean lead time: 9.0 months
Mean α drawdown: 0.20

COMPARISON TO OTHER INDICATORS
------------------------------
Indicator        Lead Time    Type
---------        ---------    ----
ECI (α)          6-15 mo      Leading (structural)
Yield curve      8-12 mo      Leading (financial)
VIX              0-1 mo       Concurrent
GDP growth       Lagging      Lagging

DETECTION PROTOCOL
------------------
1. Monitor rolling ECI (α) with 3-6 month window
2. Establish baseline α during expansion
3. Alert when α drops >15% below baseline
4. Confirm with other leading indicators
5. Lead time window: 6-18 months typically

LIMITATIONS
-----------
- COVID-2020 had only 3 mo lead (exogenous shock)
- α decline is necessary but not sufficient
- False positives possible during structural change
