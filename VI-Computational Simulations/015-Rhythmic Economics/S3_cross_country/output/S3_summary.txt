================================================
Date: 2026-02-14 18:06:58

RTM-ECON CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS
-------------------------------
α varies systematically by economy type:
- Developed: Higher α (0.48-0.55)
- Financial Hubs: Moderate α (0.40-0.44)
- Transition: Variable α (0.35-0.45)
- Emerging: Lower α (0.25-0.35)

COUNTRY RESULTS
---------------
Switzerland (Developed): α = 0.55, Crisis freq = 0.08/decade, Resilience = 0.87
Japan (Developed): α = 0.52, Crisis freq = 0.12/decade, Resilience = 0.80
Germany (Developed): α = 0.48, Crisis freq = 0.15/decade, Resilience = 0.74
South Korea (Transition): α = 0.45, Crisis freq = 0.18/decade, Resilience = 0.66
Singapore (Financial Hub): α = 0.44, Crisis freq = 0.18/decade, Resilience = 0.66
United States (Financial Hub): α = 0.42, Crisis freq = 0.20/decade, Resilience = 0.62
United Kingdom (Financial Hub): α = 0.40, Crisis freq = 0.22/decade, Resilience = 0.57
China (Transition): α = 0.38, Crisis freq = 0.15/decade, Resilience = 0.60
India (Transition): α = 0.35, Crisis freq = 0.20/decade, Resilience = 0.52
Brazil (Emerging): α = 0.32, Crisis freq = 0.35/decade, Resilience = 0.37
Turkey (Emerging): α = 0.28, Crisis freq = 0.40/decade, Resilience = 0.27
Argentina (Emerging): α = 0.25, Crisis freq = 0.50/decade, Resilience = 0.14

CORRELATIONS
------------
α vs Crisis Frequency: r = -0.905 (p = 0.0001)
α vs Avg Drawdown: r = -0.952 (p = 0.0000)
α vs GDP per capita: r = 0.801 (p = 0.0017)

TYPE AVERAGES
-------------
Developed: α = 0.52 ± 0.04
Financial Hub: α = 0.42 ± 0.02
Transition: α = 0.39 ± 0.05
Emerging: α = 0.28 ± 0.04

INTERPRETATION
--------------
1. Higher α economies have:
   - Fewer financial crises
   - Smaller crisis drawdowns
   - Higher resilience scores

2. Trade-off: High-α economies may have
   slower raw throughput but better stability

3. Policy implication: Building institutional
   buffers increases α and resilience

VALIDATION APPROACH
-------------------
1. Estimate α from firm-level recovery data
2. Aggregate by country controlling for sector
3. Compare α rankings to crisis history
4. Test predictive power for future stress
