=====================================

Date: 2026-02-09 00:59:39

TEST 1: P ∝ γ² Scaling
----------------------
Paper prediction: P scales with coupling strength squared
Fitted slope: 2.000 ± 0.000
Expected slope: 2.0
R² = 1.0000
Result: PASS ✓

TEST 2: Mesh Convergence
------------------------
Paper prediction: P changes < 1% once N is large enough
N tested: [np.int64(30), np.int64(60), np.int64(120), np.int64(240), np.int64(480)]
Convergence achieved at N ≥ 120
Result: PASS ✓

TEST 3: P vs α-Gradient
-----------------------
P increases with gradient magnitude
Fitted slope: 3.000
R² = 1.0000
Result: PASS ✓

CONCLUSION
----------
All scaling predictions from the paper are validated:
- P ∝ γ² (coupling squared)
- Mesh convergence achieved
- P depends on imposed α-gradient

The Aetherion extraction mechanism operates as predicted.
