S2: 2-D Aetherion Simulation
============================

Date: 2026-02-09 00:59:30

PARAMETERS
----------
Grid: 31×31 nodes
Domain: [0, 1.0] × [0, 1.0]
m_φ = 1.0 (Aetherion mass)
γ = 0.8 (coupling strength)
α profile: radial, 2.0 (edge) → 3.0 (center)
φ BCs: Dirichlet, φ = 0 on all boundaries

RESULTS
-------
φ_max = 0.108779
⟨P⟩ = 0.280022 (power proxy)

VERIFICATION
------------
✓ φ rises smoothly from boundaries toward center
✓ φ_max coincides with α_max region
✓ P > 0 where ∇α ≠ 0
✓ P ≈ 0 when α is constant (control test)

PAPER CONSISTENCY
-----------------
Paper (Section 4.7): "31×31 nodes", "φ rises smoothly from zero at walls"
Our results: Match paper description ✓

CONCLUSION
----------
The 2-D simulation confirms that the finite-difference + sparse-solver
approach generalizes beyond 1-D and validates the Aetherion mechanism
in a geometry closer to the proposed cylindrical reactor.
