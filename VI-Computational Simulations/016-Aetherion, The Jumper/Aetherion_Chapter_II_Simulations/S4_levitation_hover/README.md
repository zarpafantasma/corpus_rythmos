# S4: Levitation and Hover Calculator

From "Aetherion, The Jumper" - Chapter II, Section 3

## Overview
Calculates α-gradient required for stable levitation.

## Key Equation
```
Hover: F_lift = m × g
∇α = (m × g) / (κ_eff × ε_vac × A)
```

## Results
- Nanogram-scale levitation feasible
- Larger masses need enhanced ε_vac
- PD feedback provides stability
