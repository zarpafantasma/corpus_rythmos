# S2: OMV Vibration-Induced Thrust

From "Aetherion, The Jumper" - Chapter II, Section 2.2

## Overview
Models vibration-induced α-modulation and predicts measurable displacement.

## Key Equation
```
α(x,t) = α₀ + α₁ sin(kx) cos(ωt)
Δz_pp = (κ_eff × α₁² × k² × ε_vac) / (m × ω²)
```

## Paper Target
~0.5 nm displacement (detectable by interferometry)
