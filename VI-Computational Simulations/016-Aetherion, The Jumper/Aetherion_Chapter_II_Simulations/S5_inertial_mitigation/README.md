# S5: Inertial Mitigation via Temporal Decoupling

From "Aetherion, The Jumper" - Chapter II, Section 5.4

## Overview
Simulates G-force reduction inside high-α cabin.

## Key Equation
```
a_eff = a_ext / α
```

## Example
100g external + α = 50 → 2g felt

## Design Guidelines
- High α inside, low α at hull
- Dynamic α control during maneuvers
