# S1: Multi-Well Potential V(β)

From "Aetherion, The Jumper" - Chapter III, Section 3.2

## Overview
Constructs the multi-well potential for the branch field β.

## Key Equation
```
V(β) = λ × Σ_n [ (β - n)² × (β - (n+1))² ]
```

## Physics
Each minimum corresponds to a discrete RTM coherence layer ("local universe").
