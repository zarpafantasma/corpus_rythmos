S5: Grid Convergence Test
=========================

Date: 2026-02-09 01:25:00

PURPOSE
-------
Verify branch jump is not a numerical artifact.

PARAMETERS
----------
λ = 0.8
g_βα = 2.0
Δα = 0.4

RESULTS
-------
Grid    | Final β | Max β   | Jump time
5×5×5   | 0.0076  | 0.0076  | nan
7×7×7   | 0.0087  | 0.0087  | nan
9×9×9   | 0.0082  | 0.0082  | nan

CONVERGENCE
-----------
Relative change (7→9): 6.3%
Status: CONVERGED

CONCLUSION
----------
The overlap of curves across grid sizes demonstrates that
the branch-transition mechanism is robust to grid refinement.
This pre-empts concerns about resolution-limited artifacts.
