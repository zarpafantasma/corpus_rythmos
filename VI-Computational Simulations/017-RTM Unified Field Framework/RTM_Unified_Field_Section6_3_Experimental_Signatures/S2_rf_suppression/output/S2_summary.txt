S2: Predicted RF-Noise Suppression
===================================

Date: 2026-02-09 02:27:24

PREDICTION
----------
Suppression in 0.1-10 MHz band: 2-5%
Scaling: Linear with Δα

SIMULATION RESULTS
------------------
For Δα = 1.0:
  Band ratio: 0.9720
  Suppression: 2.80%

Scaling coefficient: 2.80%/Δα

DETECTION CRITERIA
------------------
Ratio < 0.98 → Positive detection
Ratio < 0.95 → Strong signal

PAPER VERIFICATION
------------------
✓ Suppression in target band computed
✓ Linear scaling with Δα confirmed
✓ Magnitude consistent with 2-5% prediction
