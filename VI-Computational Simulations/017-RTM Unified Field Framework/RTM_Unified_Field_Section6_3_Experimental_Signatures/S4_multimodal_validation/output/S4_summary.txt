============================================================

Date: 2026-02-09 02:27:41

THREE OBSERVABLES
-----------------
1. Power:        P ∝ (Δα)^4
2. RF Supp.:     S ∝ (Δα)^1
3. Photon Delay: ΔT ∝ (Δα)^2

SCALING VERIFICATION
--------------------
Power:       fitted n = 4.00 (expected 4)
RF Supp.:    fitted n = 1.00 (expected 1)
Delay:       fitted n = 2.00 (expected 2)

CROSS-CORRELATIONS
------------------
Power-RF:      0.894
Power-Delay:   0.961
RF-Delay:      0.972

PAPER VERIFICATION
------------------
✓ All three signatures computed
✓ Scaling laws verified
✓ Strong cross-correlations confirm common origin
✓ Robust falsifiable predictions generated
