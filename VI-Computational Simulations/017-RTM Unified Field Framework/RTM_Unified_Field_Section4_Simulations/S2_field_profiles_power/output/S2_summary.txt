KEY RESULTS
-----------

1-D PROFILES:
  Linear ramp: φ_max = 5.0000, P = 0.0000
  Step:        φ_max = 12.6124, P = 3.8670
  Gaussian:    φ_max = 28.9251, P = 13.3744
  Double:      φ_max = 7.1317, P = 0.0419

SCALING LAW:
  P ∝ γ^2.00
  Expected: γ²
  Verification: PASS

2-D RESULTS:
  Grid: 41×41
  Radial α profile
  φ forms concentric contours ✓
  P shows ring at max |∇α| ✓

PAPER VERIFICATION
------------------
✓ φ tracks α gradient as predicted (Section 4.2)
✓ P peaks at maximal ∇α slope
✓ P_total ∝ γ² confirmed (Section 4.2.3)
✓ 2D generalizes correctly to radial coordinates
