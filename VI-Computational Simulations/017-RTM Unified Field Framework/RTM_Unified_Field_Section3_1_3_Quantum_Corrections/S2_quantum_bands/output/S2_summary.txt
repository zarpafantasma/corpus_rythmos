S2: Quantum-Corrected α-Band Structure
======================================

Date: 2026-02-09 02:16:48

RTM BANDS
---------
Theoretical: [2.0, 2.26, 2.47, 2.61, 2.72]

QUANTUM CORRECTIONS
-------------------
Number of classical bands found: 5
Number of quantum bands found:   6

Band shifts (quantum - classical):
['-0.0360', '-0.1081', '-0.1823', '-0.1157', '-0.0765']

RG RUNNING
----------
Band positions are μ-dependent (logarithmic running).
This introduces scale dependence in RTM predictions.

PAPER VERIFICATION
------------------
✓ Quantum corrections shift minima positions
✓ Band structure preserved but modified
✓ μ-dependence demonstrates RG running
✓ Barrier heights affected by quantum corrections
