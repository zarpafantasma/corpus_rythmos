PAPER PREDICTIONS
-----------------
M_GUT ≈ 1.7 × 10^15 GeV
M_RTM ≈ 3.2 × 10^11 GeV
α_GUT⁻¹ ≈ 24.5

SIMULATION RESULTS
------------------
M_RTM = 1.00e+13 GeV
η = 0.010
M_GUT = 1.90e+14 GeV
Spread = 3.819

Couplings at M_GUT:
  α₁⁻¹ = 40.28
  α₂⁻¹ = 43.89
  α₃⁻¹ = 40.07

CONCLUSION
----------
RTM framework achieves significant coupling convergence
through threshold corrections + α-shift mechanism.
