# S2: Threshold Matching with RTM States

From "RTM Unified Field Framework" - Section 3.5.2

## Overview
One-loop threshold corrections from new RTM states at high scales.

## RTM Threshold Catalogue
- RTM scalar φ at ~3×10^11 GeV
- Heavy vector-like fermions at 10^12-10^13 GeV
- Additional scalars and vectors
