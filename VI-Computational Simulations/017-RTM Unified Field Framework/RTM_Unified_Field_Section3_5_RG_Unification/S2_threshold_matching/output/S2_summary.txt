S2: Threshold Matching with RTM States
======================================

Date: 2026-02-09 02:06:10

RTM THRESHOLDS
--------------
5 new states between 10^11 - 10^14 GeV

EFFECT AT 10^15 GeV
-------------------
SM spread:      5.50
SM+RTM spread:  4.91
Change:         -10.7%

CONCLUSION
----------
Thresholds modify the running but alone do not achieve unification.
The α-shift mechanism (Section 3.5.1) provides additional correction.
