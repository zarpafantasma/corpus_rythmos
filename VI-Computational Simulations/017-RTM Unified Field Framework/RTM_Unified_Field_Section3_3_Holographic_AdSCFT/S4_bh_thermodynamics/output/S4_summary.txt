S4: Black Hole Thermodynamics with RTM
======================================

Date: 2026-02-09 02:35:55

RTM MODIFICATIONS
-----------------
T_H^RTM = T_H × α (temperature enhanced)
S_max^RTM = S_max / α (entropy bound tightened)
I_vault ∝ 1/α (information capacity reduced)

HAWKING TEMPERATURE
-------------------
Standard (M=1): 0.0398
At α=2.0: 0.0796
At α=3.0: 0.1194

BEKENSTEIN BOUND
----------------
Standard (E=R=1): 6.2832
At α=2.0: 3.1416
At α=3.0: 2.0944

PAPER VERIFICATION
------------------
✓ Modified Hawking temperature computed
✓ Generalized Bekenstein bound implemented
✓ Information vault capacity at RTM bands
✓ Branch-jump energy thresholds computed
