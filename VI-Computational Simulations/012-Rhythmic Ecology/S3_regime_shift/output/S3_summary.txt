S3: Regime Shift Early Warning via α Decline
=============================================
Date: 2026-02-14 14:54:01

RTM-ECO HYPOTHESIS H2
---------------------
Significant declines in α anticipate regime shifts.

α drops BEFORE the ecosystem state variable transitions,
providing early warning for management intervention.

MECHANISM
---------
As stress accumulates:
1. First: α declines (coherence degrades)
2. Then: Recovery times increase
3. Finally: State variable collapses

The α decline reflects loss of ecosystem organization
before visible degradation occurs.

SCENARIO RESULTS
----------------

Forest Desertification:
  α: 0.42 → 0.18 (drop = 0.24)
  Critical point: year 80
  Early warning lead time: ~6 years

Lake Eutrophication:
  α: 0.48 → 0.22 (drop = 0.26)
  Critical point: year 70
  Early warning lead time: ~11 years

Coral Degradation:
  α: 0.50 → 0.25 (drop = 0.25)
  Critical point: year 60
  Early warning lead time: ~6 years

Grassland Invasion:
  α: 0.38 → 0.20 (drop = 0.18)
  Critical point: year 90
  Early warning lead time: ~4 years

Mean lead time: 6.8 years

DETECTION PROTOCOL
------------------
1. Monitor α through regular disturbance-recovery cycles
2. Establish baseline α (healthy ecosystem)
3. Detect when α drops >2σ below baseline
4. Trigger alert for management intervention

COMPARISON TO CLASSICAL EWS
---------------------------
Classical indicators (AR1, variance) detect "critical slowing down"
RTM α decline detects "coherence loss"

Advantages of α:
- Earlier detection (precedes state change)
- Mechanistic interpretation
- Scale-independent

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
-----------------------
1. Regular α monitoring provides early warning
2. Intervention window: lead time before collapse
3. Restoration targets: restore α to healthy levels
4. Protected areas: maintain high-α refugia
