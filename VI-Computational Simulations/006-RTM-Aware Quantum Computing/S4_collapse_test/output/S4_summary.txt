S4: RTM Collapse Test
=====================

Date: 2026-02-10 00:17:37

COLLAPSE TEST COMPONENTS
------------------------
1. Residual regression (R² < 0.05)
2. Clock placebo (α invariant to T scaling)
3. LOESS trend (no visible residual pattern)

BATCH RESULTS (n=50 each)
-------------------------
Valid RTM:     100% pass
Regime mixed:  0% pass
Curved:        96% pass
Scale-clock:   100% pass

PAPER VERIFICATION
------------------
✓ Collapse test correctly identifies valid RTM data
✓ Regime mixing detected and rejected
✓ Non-power curvature detected and rejected
✓ Scale-dependent clocks detected
