==========================================
Date: 2026-02-14 14:14:45

RTM SELECTIVITY PREDICTION
--------------------------
For competing reactions A and B:
  S(L) = k_A/k_B = (k_A_bulk/k_B_bulk) × (L/L_ref)^(α_B - α_A)

If Δα = α_A - α_B > 0:
  → Smaller pores favor product A
  → Selectivity enhancement = (L/L_ref)^(-Δα)

SCENARIO RESULTS

MATERIALS DATABASE
------------------
Zeolites:
  ZSM-5 (0.55nm), Mordenite (0.70nm), Beta (0.76nm), Y (0.74nm)
  
Mesoporous:
  MCM-41 (3.0nm), SBA-15 (8.0nm)
  
MOFs:
  ZIF-8 (1.16nm), HKUST-1 (0.9nm), UiO-66 (0.75nm), 
  MOF-5 (1.5nm), MIL-101 (3.4nm)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-----------------
1. Measure α for each reaction pathway independently
2. Calculate Δα = α_target - α_undesired
3. If Δα > 0: select smaller pores for higher selectivity
4. If Δα < 0: select larger pores or different mechanism
5. Crossover length: L* where selectivity = 1

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
-----------------------
1. Measure selectivity in bulk (no confinement)
2. Measure in series of materials with different pore sizes
3. Plot log(S) vs log(L) - slope should equal -Δα
4. Verify with data collapse: S × L^Δα = constant
