RTM-CONSCIOUSNESS PHARMACOLOGY
------------------------------
Different drugs affect α (S1) and NDI (S2) differently:

PROPOFOL (GABAergic anesthesia)
-------------------------------
- α: Decreases (0.72 → 0.28)
- NDI: Decreases (0.45 → 0.02)
- Both S1 and S2 fail
- Result: Unconsciousness (both criteria fail)
- Mechanism: Global inhibition, coherence collapse

PSYCHEDELICS (serotonergic)
---------------------------
- α: Increases (0.72 → 0.82)
- NDI: Decreases (0.45 → -0.15)
- S1 passes, S2 fails
- Result: Altered consciousness (dissociation)
- Mechanism: Enhanced local coherence, disrupted hierarchy

KETAMINE (NMDA antagonist)
--------------------------
- α: Moderate decrease (0.72 → 0.60)
- NDI: Near zero/negative (0.45 → -0.05)
- S1 borderline, S2 fails
- Result: Dissociative state

CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA
-----------------------
Normal Conscious: α > 0.5 AND NDI > 0.15
Altered Conscious: α > 0.5 AND NDI ≤ 0.15
Unconscious: α ≤ 0.5 AND NDI ≤ 0.15

KEY PREDICTIONS
---------------
1. Propofol: Both α and NDI drop during induction
2. Emergence: α recovers before NDI
3. Psychedelics: α↑ and NDI↓ simultaneously
4. Different routes to altered states visible in α-NDI space

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
---------------------
1. Monitor α for depth of anesthesia
2. NDI may indicate recovery of directional processing
3. Psychedelic states distinct from anesthesia
4. Combined S1+S2 provides richer picture than either alone
