# T1: RTM Acceleration Factor A(z) Calculator

From "Time–Scale Rescaling in Early Universe Structure Growth"

## Overview
Calculates the RTM acceleration factor A by which mesoscopic timescales are divided in the early universe.

## Key Equations
- **EdS**: A = (1+z)^(3α/2)
- **ΛCDM**: A = [Ω_m(1+z)³ + Ω_Λ]^(α/2)

## Usage
```bash
python T1_acceleration_factor.py
```

## Key Results
At z=10 with α=1:
- EdS: A ≈ 36
- ΛCDM: A ≈ 20

Processes run 20-40× faster at z=10 than today.
