E3: Ratchet/Hysteresis Under Coupling Sweeps
=============================================

Date: 2026-02-08 23:14:46

PARAMETERS
----------
Coupling range: κ = 0.1 to 0.9
Sweep steps: 20
Layers: 4
Memory strength: 0.4
Noise σ: 0.005
Bootstrap: 1000

MODEL
-----
α(κ) = α_base + Δα × sigmoid(κ - center)

The sigmoid center shifts based on sweep direction, creating hysteresis.
Up sweep: center shifts left (earlier activation)
Down sweep: center shifts right (delayed deactivation)

S3 TEST: HYSTERESIS
-------------------
Decision rule: Pass if A_hyst CI excludes 0 for ≥50% of layers

  Layer 0: A = 0.1258 [0.1234, 0.1282] ✓ Significant
  Layer 1: A = 0.1261 [0.1237, 0.1285] ✓ Significant
  Layer 2: A = 0.1272 [0.1248, 0.1298] ✓ Significant
  Layer 3: A = 0.1267 [0.1242, 0.1293] ✓ Significant

Layers with significant hysteresis: 4 / 4

OVERALL S3 RESULT: ✓ PASS

INTERPRETATION
--------------
The cascade exhibits directional memory: coherence α responds differently
to coupling increases vs decreases. This ratchet/hysteresis effect supports
the RTM hypothesis of one-way information flow with activation memory.
